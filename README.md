The Studyhive project allows users to access a wide range of courses through a user-friendly and intuitive interface. To explore our website, you can access the live demo [here](https://study-hive.vercel.app/), and if you're interested in diving into the technical details, the source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/SayedArifin/StudyHive).
